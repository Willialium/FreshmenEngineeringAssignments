#B)  Calculate the wavelength of X-rays scattering from a crystal lattice
#    with a distance between crystal layers of 0.025 nm, scattering angle of
#    25 degrees, and first order diffraction. Braggâ€™s Law describes the
#    scattering of waves from a crystal using the equation

print("This program calculates the wavelength given distance and angle")
distanceBetweenLayers = float(input("Please enter the distance (nm): "))
scatteringAngle = float(input("Please enter the angle (degrees): "))

orderDiffraction = 1

wavelength = (2 * distanceBetweenLayers * sin(radians(scatteringAngle))) / orderDiffraction # nm
